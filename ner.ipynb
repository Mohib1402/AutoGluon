        "Named entity recognition (NER) refers to identifying and categorizing key information (entities) from unstructured text. An entity can be a word or a series of words which correspond to categories such as cities, time expressions, monetary values, facilities, person, organization, etc. An NER model usually takes as input an unannotated block of text and output an annotated block of text that highlights the named entities with predefined categories. For example, given the following sentences,\n",

        "Like other tasks in AutoMM, all you need to do is to prepare your data as data tables (i.e., dataframes) which contain a text column and an annotation column. The text column stores the raw textual data which contains the entities you want to identify. Correspondingly, the annotation column stores the label information (e.g., the *category* and the *start/end* offset in character level) for the entities. AutoMM requires the *annotation column* to\n",

        "Now, let's create a predictor for named entity recognition by setting the *problem_type* to **ner** and specifying the label column. Afterwards, we call predictor.fit() to train the model for five minutes. To achieve reasonable performance in your applications, you are recommended to set a longer enough time_limit (e.g., 30/60 minutes). You can also specify your backbone model and other hyperparameters using the hyperparameters argument. Here, we save the model to the directory `\"automm_ner\"`. For the purpose of demonstration, we use the lightweighted `'google/electra-small-discriminator'` backbone."
